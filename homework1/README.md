##  Background and Landscape

    Decentralized Finance (DeFi) > Blockchain > Cryptocurrency

> *"DeFi is the movement to transform old financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that run on decentralized applications built using smart contract platforms like ethereum" (Coinbase, 2020).*

- Throughout modern history, countries have relied on a central monetary authroity to stabilize national currencies, control price inflation, conduct monetary policy and regulate banks.

- Through monetay policy, central banks control liquidity in the financial system, providing intervention to curtail economic downturns and promote stability and growth.

- We have seen this recently as the Federal Reserve reduced short term interest rates to 0% in an attempt to make liquidity cheaper. 

- While many feel that a central authority is necessary, monetay intervention intrinsically prevents markets from operating freely and subjects our financial system to biases that many limit economic opportunities for the underbanked.

- The banking system in conjunction with the central bank, has an even greater degree of power over who has access to capital.

- With the advent of and rise of Bitcoin's blockchain technology following the financial crisis, there has been a movement towards decentralized finance.
    - This, in large part, has been driven by distrust in financial and political authorities.

- The immutable distributed ledger technology initialized as a currency by Bitcoin, provides a cryptographic form of money whereby no central authority controls the supply.

- Anyone with internet connection or a smartphone can participate. 
 
        Ethereum > Dapps

 - The DeFi movement has evolved to include more sophisticated cryptocurrencies which allow for codeded applications to dictate the movement of digital value.

- Most notable is Ethereum, "the world's leading programmable blockchain" (Ethereum, 2020).
    - Ethereum's supply and transfer are not by any central authority, it is accessable to anyone with an internet connection, can be sent to anyone around the world.

- Ethereum allows developers to code financial services applications directly into the blockchain.


        MakerDAO

- MakerDAO is an "open-source project and Decentralized Autonomous Organization" which has programmed what is known as the "Maker Protocal" into the Ethereum blockchain. 

- Maker Protocal is the "law of code" which allows anyone to generate a unique currency known as Dia Stablecoin by leveraging Ethereum as collateral.
    - Unlike most cryptocurries which are realtively volatile, Dia is soft-pegged to the US dollar.
    - Dia decentralized access to a more stable source of capital than traditional cryptocurrencies.

- The organization's purpose on Cruchbase is "a decentralized autonomous organization on the Ethereum blockchain seeking to minimize the price volatility of its own stable token — the Dai — against the IMF’s international currency basket SDR" (Crunchbase).

- Despite its seemingly anonymous origins and socially progressive motives, MakerDAO is still a for profit organization owned by initial investors who now hold MKR tokens.

- MakerDAO began as a project in 2015 after being founded as a company in 2014 (Santa Cruz, CA)

- It was initiated as a collabortion between developers working together across the world. The most notable founder is Rune Christensen.

- MakerDAO has no central authority, but Maker Protocol is managed by people around the world who are designated as Maker Governance.

- MakerDAO was created in response to what the community saw as "an unprecedented opportunity to ease the public’s growing frustration with—and distrust of—dysfunctional centralized financial systems" (MakerDAO Whitepaper)

- The majority of funding has been rasied across two venture rounds, totalling $27MM.
The latest round was in September of 2018 at a $250MM valuation.

## Business Activities

- MakerDAO was one of the first to bring to market a real use case for cryptocurrency by creating a permissionless and autonomous lending platform.

- Traditional KYC requirements for obtaining a loan from a financial institution pose significant prohibitive obsticles to many and are thus financially exclusive. 

- MakerDAO serves as a proof of concept, suggesting how defi can addresses this problem by allowing anyone to anonymously take out a loan through a transparent protocol that is not subject to one centralc authority.

- The use cases for Dia are currently limited mostly to acting as margin or leverage in sophisticated cryto trading strategies.

- Nevertheless, MakerDAO has a long term vision and goal of promoting and proveing the potential for decentralized finance. 

- Prior to the recent market crash, approx $400 MM worth of crypto asset collateral was pledged in the "MakerDAO protocal stability system" (Coinbase, 2020). Although the value of pledged assets has grown, much of this is held by only a few accounts.

## Results

- Dai is one of the first and most succesful stablecoins, providing a source of greater crypto stability and certainty in a market where volatility makes traditional cryptocurrencies unreliable stores of value.

- Following MakerDAO's lead, the landscape has shifted drastically in terms of stablecoin adoption and proliferation.

## Potential 

- Although in their infancy, projects and protocals such as MakerDAO are foundational in building out use cases for cryptocurrency, sparking adoption and bringing crypto economy opportunities which exist on the Ethereum blockchain into a broader economic context. 

- Specifically, MakerDAO presents a use case for blockchain and decentralized banking services in the lending space, making financing more accessable and reducing the prohibitive obsticles of traditional banking. 

- It is crucial that moving forward, these companies begin to make their mission and how they operate more accessable and understandable to the braoder public as much of the crypto community is incomprehensible to those who are unfamiliar with the technology.
